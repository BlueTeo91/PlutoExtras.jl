# PlutoUtils

This package provides some very opinionated functionalities to work with PlutoNotebooks

This is mostly meant for personal use I will try to see if something can be adapted and made generic if you file an issue.

The most useful additional functionality (for other users) so far is overloading the show function for PlotlyBase.Plot items
This functionality is implemented in [the plolty_show.jl notebook](./src/plotly_show.jl)
